              Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a fatal disease. Most of the
              people have never heard of SMA, a rare genetic disease. But it is
              the truth that many children are born with the rare disease around
              the world including Bangladesh every year and they are to die
              without treatment and knowing about the disease.
              <br />
              <br />
              Only those who are affected or whose children are affected by this
              disease understand how cruel this disease is. If a child has
              type-1 of SMA, he or she can die within 20 months if not treated
              at the right time. Only the sufferers know how helpless parents
              spend their days after knowing this fact.
              <br />
              <br />
              In our country, the treatment of this disease is not very common,
              even the overall treatment of the disease is not available. In
              this situation, awareness and concerted efforts of all can be used
              to organize preventive measures.
              <br />
              <br />
              Most of the people in our country are not aware of this disease.
              At this moment, we need very much awareness to prevent the
              disease. Except in rare cases, SMA is inherited in an autosomal
              recessive manner, so young people can perform blood and some other
              tests before marriage to avid the complexity.
              <br />
              <br />
              We are a few generous minded people who have come together to help
              everyone by providing accessible and accurate information on the
              treatment of this disease. For this, it is important to come
              forward with the cooperation and positive mindset of people from
              all levels of society.
              <br />
              <br />
              The name of our organization is Cure SMA Bangladesh. We especially
              want family members affected by this disease. We hope that our
              journey will be smoother if you come forward.

              SMA is a rare and complex congenital disease of the nervous system
              caused by genetic disorder. As the nerve cells that control the
              muscles are damaged, the muscles become weak and destroy spinal
              cord of children. The newborns suffering from this disease
              continue to weaken. They cannot sit or stand, their necks do not
              stiff. But they possess normal intelligence. The children with SMA
              die due to respiratory complications and congenital heart disease.
              <br />
              <br />
              SMA tops the list of genetic diseases which causes more deaths of
              children in the world. It is learnt that a multinational
              pharmaceutical company, Novartis, has developed a completely gene
              therapy to treat spinal muscular atrophy in children less than 2
              years of age. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also
              approved the therapy. This gene therapy costs around Tk 22 crore
              for a single dose.
              <br />
              <br />
              It is also learnt that for the first time in Bangladesh, gene
              therapy was used to treat SMA of 22-month-old baby Raihan for free
              of cost. Raihan was lucky selected in a global project lottery and
              he was given a dose of medicine worth Taka 22 crore.
              <br />
              <br />
              Earlier on March 20 in 2022, Roche Bangladesh Limited provided
              oral medicine at free of cost to a child. On this day, a
              nine-month-old baby Olivia Sanchari Nabani was fed the first dose
              of oral medicine. She is now receiving treatment under Assistant
              Professor of Bangladesh Shishu Hospital &amp; Institute Dr. Shaoli
              Sarkar. Roche Bangladesh Limited has already got approval for
              selling the drugs in Bangladesh.
